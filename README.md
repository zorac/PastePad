# PastePad - less is more

PastePad is a text editor for the Mac with a deliberately minimal feature set.
If you want something with more functionality, you already have TextEdit!

PastePad caters to the workflow where you want to copy some text from another
application, maybe make some changes to it, and then paste it somewhere else.
Any features that might slow down that process have been removed. Compared to
TextEdit, this is what you get:

* No loading - opening the app immediately gives you a blank window
* No saving - close a window and it's gone, without any annoying prompts
* Open a new window from the dock icon - makes life easier if you have multiple
  desktops
* All auto-correction forced off - no unwanted smart quotes
